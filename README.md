At Assurant, helping people thrive in a connected world is a core purpose, and BetterKnightsUI aligns with this mission by enhancing the digital course selection experience at UCF. This extension integrates key data points, such as professor ratings and class availability, into a user-friendly interface, simplifying academic decision-making.
